# Google & Wikipedia clones

This clones was made to practice in the Platzi course "Curso Pr√°ctico de HTML y CSS"

The folder named "first_google_clone" is the clone of google that I did before take the course and the project named "google_clone" was the project that we did during the course.

The folder named "WikiClone" contain a clone of Wikipedia home page, that was the final challenge of the course.
